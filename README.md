# TESTING

As this project is static and contains no back-end functionality, the testing performed will be on the visual effects and layout of the Website. Testing to be done on at least three web browsers and all screen sizes.

No elements should overlap another container div. All carousel items should be controllable with the mouse as well as sliding on a timer.

All nav links should direct to the correct html pages as per their names. The Home page is the exception, this one will redirect to index.html.

All links to external websites must open in a new browser.

Testing of form validation will also be required to ensure the correct inputs are taken and that all fields are required.

Validation of inclusion for all features included in the Structure of the Website / Wireframes must be performed.
